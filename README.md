# OneHourWalker for iOS - a HealthKit demo

HealthKit is Apple’s bridge from the important, trackable health data to the health-conscious tech-consumer, exercise-fan, and regular person with an iPhone. That’s cool. A user can easily track measurable fitness and health data over a period of time. Aside from the benefit of awareness, seeing the positive slope in the graph is inspiring and a great motivator.

As one would imagine, security is of paramount importance when managing health information. HealthKit places absolute control of all HealthKit information squarely into the hands of the user. The user can grant or deny permission to any app that requests access to their health data.

For the developer, we need to ask permission to read or write data to HealthKit. In fact, we need to specifically state the data for which we would like to access or affect. Additionally, any app that uses HealthKit must contain a Privacy Policy, so the user can feel more comfortable with the transaction of information.
